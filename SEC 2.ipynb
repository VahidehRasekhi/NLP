The\\nCompany’s lease contracts generally range from\\xa01\\nyear\\xa0to\\xa060\\xa0years, with some lease contracts\\ncontaining one or more lease extension options, exercisable at the\\nCompany’s discretion. The Company generally does not include these\\nlease extension options in the initial lease term as it is not\\nreasonably certain that it will exercise such options at contract\\ninception. In addition, certain lease arrangements contain fixed\\nand variable lease payments. The variable lease payments are\\nprimarily contingent rental payments based on: (i) a percentage of\\nrevenue related to the leased property; (ii) payments based on a\\npercentage of sales over contractual levels; or (iii) lease\\npayments adjusted for changes in an index or market value. These\\nvariable lease payments are typically recognized when the\\nunderlying event occurs and are included in operating expenses in\\nthe Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same\\nline item as the expense arising from the respective fixed lease\\npayments. The Company’s lease agreements may also include non-lease\\ncomponents, such as common area maintenance and insurance, which\\nare accounted for separately. Future lease payments that are\\ncontingent and non-lease components are not included in the\\nmeasurement of the operating lease liability. The Company’s lease\\nagreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or\\nrestrictive covenants. Lease expense related to lease payments is\\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the\\nlease.', 'The\\nCompany’s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit\\nrate. As a result, the Company measures the lease liability using\\nan estimated incremental borrowing rate which is intended to\\nreflect the rate of interest the Company would pay on a\\ncollateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease\\npayments under similar terms. The Company applies the estimated\\nincremental borrowing rates at a portfolio level based on the\\neconomic environment associated with the lease.', 'The\\nCompany uses the long-lived assets impairment guidance to determine\\nrecognition and measurement of an ROU asset impairment, if any.
