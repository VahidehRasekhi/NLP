On August 20, 2021, the Company repurchased and retired 6,849,315 shares of its Class A Common Stock from the Platinum Stockholder at a price per share of $14.60, which was equal to the price at which the underwriter exercised the overallotment option for the secondary offering discussed above. The Company paid $100 million to fund the share repurchase using existing cash on hand. The Company accounted for the share repurchase and retirement under the cost method by deducting its par value from the common stock account, reducing $72.0 million in the additional paid-in-capital account using the share price when the stock was originally issued, and the remaining excess cost of $28.0 million by increasing the accumulated deficit account.\n",

      "On August 9, 2021, the Company announced that its Board authorized a share repurchase program for up to an aggregate amount of $100 million of its outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock. On August 20, 2021, the Company repurchased and retired 6,849,315 shares of its Class A Common Stock from the Platinum Stockholder at a price per share of $14.60, which was equal to the price at which the underwriter exercised the overallotment option for the secondary offering discussed above. The Company paid $100 million to fund the share repurchase using existing cash on hand. The Company accounted for the share repurchase and retirement under the cost method by deducting its par value from the common stock account, reducing $72.0 million in the additional paid-in-capital account using the share price when the stock was originally issued, and the remaining excess cost of $28.0 million by increasing the accumulated deficit account.\n",
